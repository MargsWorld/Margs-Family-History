                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span class="style">Stirring Exploits of Young Australian Soldiers<br /></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span class="style">From AXEL OLSEN, &quot;Argus&quot; War Corresponden</span>t<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_3">SOMEWHERE IN NEW GUINEA: High in the mountain jungles of New Guinea between Wau and Salamaua one of the most magnificent chapters in the history of Australian fighting is being written by some of Australia's finest soldiers.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">It is a story that began nearly 6 months ago, when the Japanese were beaten back from the very edge of the Wau aerodrome while aircraft landed under Japanese fire to bring reinforcements to the hard-pressed defenders. It is a story of endurance stretched to breaking point; of long months of stalking the Japanese through the world's worst jungle, of heroism so universal as to be commonplace; of endless knee-deep mud; of rain, cold, sickness, and un- believable hardship; of death and victory. It is a story of the average Australian-the lad you knew a few years ago-changed now to a warrior great to the point of nobility.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">In the sinister jungle there is no distinction between AIP or CMF. The men are simply Australian soldiers, splendidly trained to fight a super- human battle over every inch of the ghastly Jungle. They are beating the enemy in every encounter, gradually pushing him farther and farther toward the coast.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">An officer with wide Middle East experience talked with the first war correspondents allowed in the area, and warmly praised the achievements of the men-both AIP and CMP.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">&quot;The most pleasing aspect of operations to date,&quot; he said, &quot;is the really good work done by the Militia boys. You may tell the people at home, particularly the old hands of the last war, that the boys have shot away any slur ever cast on the Militia by their downright good fighting qualities, toughness, and a real ambition to prove themselves, so far as they are able, second to none.&quot;<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">A complete history of the exploits of these men could make 6 full length books. Every day they do amazing things. Every man has a hair-raising story of the Japanese infested jungle. And the jungle is as great an enemy as the Japanese.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_5">SUN NEVER SHINES<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">In mountains which rise higher than Kosciusko the dank trunks of huge, rotting trees are inextricably twined with vine and scrub. The only tracks through the perpetually rain-sodden undergrowth are muddy morasses with logs thrown across them to give foothold. It is a weird, wet world on which the sun never shines. Malaria and scrub typhus are ever-present danger«. Any bush might conceal a Japanese sniper. Any part of the track might hold a booby trap. Every man has to be on the alert day and night. Every second is fraught with death.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">Yet Australians are cheerfully overcoming all these boundless difficulties and proving superior to the vaunted Japanese jungle fighters.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">The spirit of every man was revealed in an account given by an officer of an action in which his men were engaged.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">&quot;The jungle is cruel country, and the men who had been in it for months had to cover a particularly difficult area,&quot; he said. &quot;One company was attacked by a whole battalion of Japs and cut off for 48 hours. They held their ground and inflicted very heavy casualties. So good was battle discipline that, although the Japs were skulk- ing round all night, our men did as they were told and held.their fire until morning. Not one shot was fired. Even in the day visibility was limited to 15 or 20 yards. The Japs launched 7 attacks and each one was beaten off.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">&quot;There were dozens of instances of bravery. One man was wounded, and, although we knew that the Japs always cover our wounded in the hope of shooting the rescuers, a lad from the regimental aid post, who was formerly a Melbourne window-dresser, sneaked out to the wounded man, lit a cigarette, and by its light stitched and dressed the wound before bringing him back. Two other men were in a machine gun pit which was being fired on by the Japs. One man was wounded and taken to the aid post and the other carried on. A If g of the bipod and part of the foresight of the machine gun were shot away, and the remaining man, deciding that the Japs were getting too accurate, moved forward, wiped out his attackers, and then resumed firing.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_5">IMPRESSIVE RESCUE<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">&quot;Rescue of the beleaguered men was one of the most impressive things I have ever seen,&quot; declared the officer. &quot;We had one shot at getting them out and were beaten off, but in the second go we got them. Every man look part. Even the cook took his rifle and went out, but not before he had put on the evening meal. You should have seen their faces. I have never known a more determined group of men. I told them there was a big slice of the enemy between them and their cobbers, and all they said was, 'Don't worry, sir. We'll get them.' And they did. In the action we inflicted 150 casualties for practically no losses.&quot;<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">Two lads from a unit which has accounted for 612 Japanese for only slight casualties gave a vivid ac- count of one of the dozens of their experiences. They were Pte Brian Walpole, 20, of Kew, Melbourne, and Cpl Frank Wilson, 22, of Summer Hill, Sydney. Walpole was formerly a bank clerk and Wilson a salesman.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">&quot;I'm a Jap hunter, and my speciality is Jap réccos,&quot; Walpole said. &quot;You'd be told to go and locate the Japs, and out you'd go into the bush. We wanted to know what they were doing on the Komiatum track, so 3 of us went out to bush-bash through a moss forest. Everything is covered in moss. There is muddy moss 6ft underfoot, and you have to step across tree roots which grow above the moss. If you miss, down you go into sticky moss. Every tree is rotten, and if you grab even one of the thickest of the mossy branches it breaks off.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">&quot;We came to the main Komiatum track, and were having a smoke when we spotted about 20 Japs coming towards us. They did not see us, and they also stopped to smoke, talking and laughing and taking off their packs and rifles. We were after information, so we held our fire and crept quietly toward them. It took us half an hour to go 70 yards, and when we were 40 yards away from them we stopped and watched. We were itching to have a go at them. Some were 6ft tall and very solid. When they had finished smoking they moved down the track, and we snuggled into the ground a bit more as they passed close by us.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">&quot;We have been in dozens of scraps. They sent over a battalion to do us over, and we licked them. They sent over 40 divebombers, and we did not get one casualty. It was a miracle of tile war.&quot;<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_5">AMBUSHED IN FOREST<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">Wilson was ambushed by Japanese in a moss forest, and cut off from his patrol. &quot;I went up the side of a mountain and could see Japs 60ft below looking for me. I then tried to find a way out of the bush. I had one tin of bully beef and 2 emergency rations, and after reading my compass decided to go west. I nearly did! I waited until dusk and circled a Jap staging camp, un- decided whether to let them have a hand grenade or not. I thought better of it. I fell down a cliff and landed in the river, and then I bush-bashed through the scrub. I was wet through and very cold, and had had nothing to eat, as I was saving my rations. I made a hole under a log and spent the night there in the rain.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">&quot;Next day, still soaked, I did some more bush-bashing. I opened the tin of bully beef, cut it in 3 pieces, and had one piece at night. The second night I again slept in the open. A flesh wound was getting stiff, but was not very painful. I was cold, wet, and very hungry. The third day I continued bush-bashing, and ate another piece of bully beef and a milk tablet from my emergency ration. The beef was bad and made me sick. The third night I tried to build a shelter, but I couldn't sleep.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">&quot;I was just about nuts by this time, and was arguing with myself why the sun would not rise. The next day the sun came out, and, after checking my compass, I eyed my rations and gave myself 2 days to get back. I bashed up a dirty great&quot; hill and came out on a Jap observation post. I nearly died of fright. I went down the Jap track, and then ran into one of our own ambushes, Australians sprang out of the bush ready to have a go at me, but when they found who I was they put men on the right track.&quot;<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_5">&quot;100% SOLDIERS&quot;<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">A Militia unit in action for the first time acquitted themselves so splendidly that they were later described by an astute and experienced Middle East campaigner as &quot;100% soldiers.&quot;<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">They moved into position in a 20 hour, 3-day walk through the jungle, and carried heavy loads of ammunition, rations, and personal gear. A few days later a patrol of 10 men moved out toward the Japanese positions, and in tall kunai grass ran into an ambush of 20. The Japanese opened fire with everything they had, but did no damage. Next morning, just before daylight, the Japanese attacked, and when the light became better were seen in large numbers trying to encircle our positions, with another large body trying to push forward. A fierce fight began, with the Australians never letting up for one instant.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">After about 1 1/2 hours our line of communication was cut, and about noon, after roughly 7 hours' fighting, a large party of Japanese was seen moving toward the rear. A running fight began along a ridge 900 yards long and well exposed to the enemy, but despite the far greater strength of the enemy and their fierce, incessant fire, not one Australian was hit. &quot;We were under very heavy fire,&quot; one man said, &quot;but once again it was brought out what rotten shots the Japs are. Things were hot while that scrap lasted.&quot;<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">In the action the unit inflicted 52 casualties for only 2 of our men wounded. One wounded man was carried by natives for 16 hours. Three days later the Australians moved forward, only to find that the Japanese had gone. A 4 hours* patrol the next day failed to find them. Apparently they had not relished their first taste of the Militia, who are now bringing new honour to a much-misused word.<br /></p>
