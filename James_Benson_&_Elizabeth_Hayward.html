                  <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 20px; " class="style_1">The late James Benson was born in Dublin on the 12th March, 1817 and came to Australia in 1841, being shipmates with Mr and Mrs East of Kiama and Mr and Mrs Whiting of Parramatta. These preceded him to the &quot;Better Land.&quot; In Ireland, though a member of the Church of England, he often attended the Methodist Church and Class Meetings; and he has left a large collection of class tickets, some of which he received there. Often did he recall with pride and admiration the preaching and doings of the notorious Gideon Ousley.<br /></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 20px; " class="style_1">Not long after his arrival in Australia he took his family to reside in the neighbourhood of Darlinghurst, in the neighbourhood of William Street. At first he associated himself with the Church of England but occasionally attended the Methodist services in a tent in Dowling Street. When the Dowling Street church was built he became a member and worked in connection with it. In our fine church in William Street, which took the place of that in Dowling Street, he and his family were well known and highly respected. He was a quiet, loyal, earnest, hearty Christian - one who could be relied upon. The late Rev. James Watkin, when superintendent of the circuit, made him a class leader.<br /></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 20px; " class="style_1">Thirteen years ago he made the family home in Randwick, where he spent the eventide of his life in such Christian service as his declining strength permitted, and in a sweet and ever-increasing devotion to God, which made it a great pleasure to others to converse with him. His latter days of faith and communion with God and his peaceful death were &quot; the index at the end&quot; of a long life of 87 years, practically the whole of which was devoted to God.A few weeks ago his extreme weakness made him feel that the end was not far off. On the 4th December he retired, as usual, to rest, and at 10 o'clock was heard praying and concluding with the Lord's prayer, and within an hour he had quietly crossed the Jordan into the promised land. Earth was the poorer, but heaven was the richer.<br /></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 20px; " class="style_1">We laid his body to rest in the Long Bay cemetery, beside that of his wife, who predeceased him only by a few months, in the presence of many friends who instinctively paid to his memory the compliment of saying, &quot;Let my last end be like his.&quot;<br /></span></p>
