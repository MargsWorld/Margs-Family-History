                  <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style">Untiring public worker, clean sportsman, unobtrusive philanthropist - Mr Harry Walker Benson, who died at his home in Paton St., Merrylands will be keenly missed. A mile of cars following his remains to Rookwood Crematorium on Monday spoke eloquently of a public life which had gained him many friends and no enemies.His widely-varied interests over a period of 20 years brought him in close touch with every form of local activity. <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">Born at Gundagai forty five years ago the late Mr Benson was educated at Paddington Public School. He was intended for the law but at the close of his school days he entered the tobacco industry in Queensland. Subsequently he left for Western Australia where he took up gold mining working at Boulder and Kalgoorlie. On the death of his father twenty two years ago he came to Merrylands and took over the tile and pottery factory established by his father some years before. Entirely ignorant of the technique of the industry, he showed amazing adaptability in learning the secrets of the craft. At the time of his death he was an expert.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">The story of his early days at Merrylands is one of struggle. Living alone in a house on a factory estate, frequently cooking his own meals, he worked unremittingly to expand the business. He added six kilns, enlarged the estate, and made the firm one of the most important in the district. His success was the reward of sheer hard work. Bringing new ideas to the industry, he invented a new class of tile - the &quot;pantil&quot; - which did most to oust the french tile from the Australian market. The popular &quot;Moravian&quot; tile was one of his more recent manufactures.His association with public life dates from the early part of his residence at Merrylands. During the war he was actively associated with all soldier-welfare movements, and was one of the strongest supporters of the Red Cross. He was prominently identified with the volunteer movement to build homes for disabled soldiers.His support of efforts to assist St. Joseph's and Auburn District Hospitals was but another feature of his endefatigable public activities. As a father he leaves  a widow, one son and one daughter/ the keen interest in Merrylands Parents and Citizen's Association.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">In 1926 he became an Alderman of Holroyd Council. The bluff outspoken personality  which characterised the whole of his life made him a noted figure in municipal politics. Ill health compelled him to retire at the end of three years.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">A keen sporting enthusiast, his interests were wide. He was an amateur boxer of repute and an excellent wrestler, a fine tennis player and an enthusiastic golfer. Although not physically a big man he was phenomenally strong and delighted in weight-lifting.A well-equipped gymnasium at his home bore evidence of his delight in athletics.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">Until eight or ten years ago, the late Mr Benson was intensely interested in motor-cycling. He was a familiar figure in 24 hour reliability tests.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">Horticulture was another of his absorbing interests. The garden of his beautiful home at Merrylands West was a district show-place ; and the bushes and trees on the at Merrylands West was a district show-place; and the bushes and trees of the property were estimated by an expert to be worth nearly 2000 pounds.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">He was a member of Parramatta Bowling Club, Parramatta Golf Club, Sydney Press Club and many other organisations.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">A Mason, he was Past Master of Lodge St. George (Parramatta) and Lodge Wentworthville.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">Philanthropy played a large part in Mr Benson's life. His purse was ever ready at the disposal of those in need and the sum of his unknown benefactions cannot be told.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">The district loses by his death one of its most popular figures. A strong character and a plain speaker, straightforward and honest in his dealing with all men, he made no enemies. Courage was the keynote of his whole life - through long years dogged by failing health - and <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">it persisted to the end.Harry Walker Benson is dead. But his memory lives.<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style">He bought the tile works from Judge Holroyd; when he had it it was the first tile works in N.S.W.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph_style_2">20,000,000 LAST YEAR<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_3">‘Behind the hundreds of thousands of red-tiled roofs which are a feature of Sydney’s landscape, there is a romance of Australian industry. A story which shows that Australians are as clever as manufacturers as any race in the world.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_3">In NSW last year 20 million roofing tiles were manufactured, yet 20 years ago less that 1 million were made here, and, even as late as 1914, 16 million roofing were imported and about 2 million made here. The imports came nearly all from France.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_3">The war gave Australians their opportunity in this particular industry, and they seized it immediately. Tiles could only be had in small quantities from France 1914. She too was busily engaged in making munitions to bother about tiles, and there was tremendous demand for the tiles in this country.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_3">NONE IMPORTED<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_3">At once far-seeing men commenced to erect factories and turn out tiles, and the industry rapidly found its feet, and it has grown ever since. Since the war local manufacturers have retained the market despite, the competition from abroad, and last year not one roofing tile was imported.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_3">The first tiles made in Australia were of the old English style pattern, and were manufactured in a little factory erected by Judge Holroyd at Merrylands. The attempt was not very successful for although the articles made was of good quality, competition from abroad was fierce and the business was unprofitable, and the judge closed the factory.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_3">Several tried unsuccessfully to revive the business, but it was not until the war years that Mr H Walker Benson secured the old kilns, renovated and extended them, and made the business a success. He still controls the business of the factory, although it is now a huge placed compared with the old premises. A son of the one of the judge’s first tile workers is still actively engaged in the manufacture of tiles. This is Mr Joe Underwood, who, with a partner, Mr Newman, successfully operates one of the best tile factories in the State, that of Newman and Underwood, Ltd., of Merrylands.<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_3">Goodlet and Mr Smith’s were also early manufacturers of tiles, and the success of the venture at Merrylands and that of Mr Walker Benson, induced others to start their factories there, with the result that the area within three miles Of Merrylands is the centre of the business in the State. A couple of miles away is the huge factory of Wunderlich, which is the biggest of its kind in the Commonwealth. In that area are nine factories. Altogether there are 24 factories for the manufactures of tiles in New South Wales.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph_style_6">Harry Walker Benson was born in Gundagai on the 25th April 1887 and was baptised on the 6th June 1887. He married Doris Helena Rose Lewis in 1916 and he died on the 3rd Feb 1934 at his home in Merrylands, NSW of leukemia myeloid. He was 47 years of age.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_6">Harry went to Queensland after school and worked in the tobacco industry before going to Western Australia mining gold at Kalgoorlie and Koolgardie. He took over the tile works at Merrylands from his father who bought it from Judge Holroyd. It was the first tile works in New South Wales.<br /></p>
