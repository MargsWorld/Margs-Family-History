At that stage we were very short of personnel owing to battle casualties and sickness, we had been in action too long, as well as tropical sickness’ such as malaria, scrub typhus and tropical ulcers and all sorts of biting and sucking insects not to mention leeches and rations that were pretty light on. It took 5 days to carry stuff over Double Mountain, which was about 10,000 ft at the highest point, where it was known to snow at night, not a good trip if you happened to be a stretcher case; it would take 18 carriers to get a stretcher back to where it could be taken to hospital in a jeep and so you had to be real crook if you got a stretcher out, not a pleasant thought for the badly wounded or very sick.&#10;You wanted some information about the Battle of Brisbane? It turned out the best blue we ever had and we weren’t the cause of it either. It all started after an exercise at Canungra where we were to take the town from the local Home Defence and militia as a wartime exercise for them, and hold it for 12 hours. This wasn’t real hard as when we looked at it there was only a post office, telephone exchange, banks and a hospital that needed taking, these held all the girls in town so we really enjoyed it. We decided the easiest way of keeping them from escaping was to hold a dance at the town hall which happened to be next to the pub. However we didn’t allow for the Brisbane train arriving at 8 pm so we had to decide what to do with all the male captives as no one wanted the job of guarding them for an hour.  It was decided to remove all shoes, pants, etc. from the men and lock them in the waiting room till the train left. However some people didn’t approve of this and wrote a letter of disapproval to Army Brass, this took a while but eventually caught up with us.&#10;George Warfe thought we had been such good boys that he decided a bit of leave in Brisbane would do us good. It was decided that a platoon at a time would be sent in to Brisbane in our transport, this would then pick us up and return us to camp before breakfast: then take another lot in the next day for the same deal until we all had a day in town.&#10;This started off as a first class movement but got fucked up at the beginning by a Yankee provost who shot one of our blokes and put him in hospital. This upset our blokes a bit and the canteen was wrecked and the American Army declared war. Instead of our blokes going home they went back and got the rest of the Company and made a good blue of it. Even the 6th divvy blokes joined as well as the 6th divvy provosts and any other Aussie in Brisbane at the time, a lot of steam was let off that had been bottling up for a long time.&#10;The outcome of all these good intentions was that the whole unit was confined to barracks for 6 months by the generals of the Australian Army.&#10;As we had not had any home leave for 12 months this was quite a blow to the boys so George Warfe, being the great diplomat, decided a Regimental Parade with all the trimmings would be the thing to get us back into the good books once more. So the day was organized where we would show them what good soldiers we could be if necessary. The Engineers were going to capture the Brigadier  - by blowing up the way in then blocking the way out the same way. This started off well and the road was completely blocked by the front tree straight across the road – but the driver of the Brig’s car was either a good driver or very scared, as he had it in reverse in no time and was moving back when the next one went off, to lob the tree fair on top of the Brig’s car. It didn’t do it any good, or the Brass any good either. So we were promised a berth on the first boat to leave Australia never to come home anymore.&#10;It just happened that about this time the Nips decided to take Wau, and us being as we were were nominated for the job of giving them the first bloody nose for a long time. We were thankful to the Middle East reinforcements at this stage as they had some battle experience with bombing raids and artillery fire, they made a lot of difference the first time in action and was all that was needed as a steadying force.&#10;I was trained as a sniper and believe me the first job I had caused me many white hairs and nervous moments. Not only did everyone see or hear somebody up a tree just before dark but we were always out in the bush miles from anywhere with practically no cover and nobody we knew for miles about, or so it seemed, also the darker it got the more Nips you could see behind every bush and tree looking for stupid bastards like us to get our throats cut for sure. I must have had 10 false alarms the first watch, it was not until 1990 that I found out about tree kangaroos and that maybe it was these blokes that I had seen or heard. So I apologise for what I called them at the time.&#10;by John Stait" title="" /><map name="map1" id="map1"><area href="http://www.ozatwar.com/ozatwar/bob.htm" title="http://www.ozatwar.com/ozatwar/bob.htm" alt="http://www.ozatwar.com/ozatwar/bob.htm" coords="5, 5, 650, 1012" /></map>

                  <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style"><span class="style">A lesson in refrigeration</span><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">After arriving at Wau, Toppy, Dick Merritt and I were sent out on recce across the river, turn right and try and find the Jap Track, which we never did. I think we spent two days trying to bash our way through bush a pig couldn’t get through.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">The first night we decided we had better have two hours on and two hours off listening for Nips which at that time we expected were behind every tree. Toppy took the first two hour watch, so we got two hours sleep, however that was the last sleep we had until it was his turn again. He no sooner went to sleep than he began to snore and I guess you could have heard us back in Wau, so when Toppy was asleep someone had to keep awake to try and stop him snoring.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">We got back to Wau just in time to go through the Coffee Plantation then down to The Slaughterhouse and Crystal Creek where Kitch Feeney was killed and Alan Henchman wounded. We were going very carefully up the track towards Skindiwai when we were told to turn off to the left and contact C Platoon on the Jap Track; this meant about 2,000 ft down and about the same up again. About this time Tiny, Sticky and I decided it would be best to keep one blanket between the three of us, we could then carry a couple of more tins of bully beef and biscuits, sounded good at the time.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Finally made it to the Jap Track and proceeded very carefully to the right trying to catch up to George Warfe, Bull Jefferies and C Platoon. You could tell they were ahead by the body count. We finally caught up with some of them, a bit hazy now who or where but I can remember having grenades rolled down the hill at us. The only other things that stick in my mind were the stink, the mud and the rain that never stopped, plus the fact that we never did get to try out sleeping three to one blanket. We weren’t game to sleep, there were still quite a few Nips about.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">We camped near a big tree with large buttressed roots that made good cover but bad sleeping conditions, so we decided to make use of the extra tin of bully beef and biscuits. Out came the canned meat and the biscuits and Sticky opened the tin of bully and placed it on a tree root, things were looking a trifle better when suddenly the ground began shaking and rumbling, twigs and leaves raining down, after a couple of minutes this stopped, but the bully had vanished down between the tree roots that must have been about fifteen feet deep. If ever you are up on the Jap Track, know there is a tin of bully somewhere down there.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Poor old Norm was just about in tears over the loss of the bully and was convinced that he would die of starvation in a godforsaken country fit only for earthquakes and beetles; however the biscuits, being indestructible, were still in fair condition and we spent the night munching on our share of them.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">The next day a section was sent across to the Black Cat Track to follow it to its junction with the Jap Track and set up an ambush position. Who was there I can’t remember; Spike, Norm, Jim Wunhym, Sticky, Tiny and myself and either Arthur or Blue, by that time I was so buggered that I wasn’t taking much notice and my ribs were touching my backbone. This is where the first lesson in refrigeration came in, we set up the ambush position and of course the necessary guard timings. Sticky was on 8 to 10, Tiny 10 to 12 and I from 12 to 2, so for the first four hours there were only two to the blanket, this wasn’t too bad once you had the water you were lying in warmed up a bit; however the rot set in at two o’clock when I tried to get a bit of the blanket. By this time Tiny had half the blanket firmly wrapped around him and Sticky had the other half just as well secured leaving a space of something less than a foot for me to try and get into. That blanket was stretched so tight you could have played a drum concerto on it. Trying to insert my skinny body into this restricted space triggered a lot of abuse about letting cold water in and when finally achieved I found there was about six inches between me and the blanket through which dripped a constant stream of water. With a fair breeze blowing this created an efficient example of an evaporative cooler.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">By first light I was nearly frozen stiff. I had never been so cold and miserable in my life. It didn’t improve matters to find that Warfe and Bull had chased all the Nips through before we got into position and their party returning were the first lot in.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Warfe greeted me with, ‘What no shave soldier?’ And not being in a very good mood up spoke Bold Horatio, … ‘and no bloody breakfast either sir!’ <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">‘That’s no excuse soldier, I expect to see you clean shaven.’ <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">I tried, ‘That’s all right for the blokes with bum fluff but try shaving this off with a week old rusty 7 o’clock.’ <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">‘You blokes carry own down to Haus Kapa and if there are no Nips head back to HQ and you Pancho, see me when you get back!’<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Sticky now made my day by predicting I would be on constant latrine digging for the rest of the war, that is, if  not shot for telling the Major that he only grew bum fluff. Something I hadn’t thought of.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Tilson was no better, he had me on constant recce till the Nips got me! So off we go, thinking that when we get to Haus Kapa we will, at least be able to get a bit dry, and have a warm feed, if we have any left. A couple of hours later and there it was, not a ‘tin house’ but a couple of sheets of iron leaning against a log. <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">To really set things going, we all ended up with the trots. This is when Tiny invented the Jap Track Nappies. You undo the back seat of your pants, crutch to belt, opening becomes automatic, beats having them off all the time, but a bit draughty between times.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">After a couple of nights sleeping in a refrigerator we finally got back to HQ, reported in, had a feed and I borrowed a blade from Robbie, and as clean and well dressed as practicable, reported back to front-up to the Major. He greeted me with, ‘Glad you’re all back OK. Here take these, and I expect to see you clean shaven in future!’<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">And he handed me two packets of brand new <span class="style_1">Blue Gillettes!<br /></span></p>

                  <p class="Free_Form"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">Toilets, latrines and thunderboxes are all necessary for the smooth running of army units especially in the Australian Army; they range in size from one holers, two holers up to six, which is fairly large and awkward to construct and build in a hurry.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">This was a job for the Pioneer Battalion but as we were only a small unit so we supplied our own builders from those available at the time which was usually walking wounded or blokes on light duties, etc. We built one up on the Black Cat Track that was a six holer and the pride of the 2/3rd as it was constructed at the end of a ridge overlooking the Wau Valley about three thousand feet below. High enough to look down on great fights between Zero’s and Air Colera’s ?, etc. It was well camouflaged and the nip snipers could not get a shot at you and knock off the conversations and rumours that happened there, this I think is where most of the war was organized …  forward plans were made for future battles. I never struck a Brigadier or General on one but no doubt they had to use one some time or other. <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">So much for the users, but the construction had to be on Army plans which was 6 feet deep x 18 inches wide, the same size as a slit trench in case things got too hot, but things had to be real crook before you would use one for that purpose. You had to allow 2 feet for each seat which had to have a lid that would close to keep the flies out or in, I don’t know which. So for a six holer you had a 6’ x 14’ x 1 ½’ slit trench with a row of seats with lids on built over the hole. If it was a 1st class one you might have a shelter over it to keep the sun and a bit of the rain off the users, if they were not comfortable the rumours tended to be bad. They had to be scrubbed clean each day and cleaned up around and sprayed with disinfectant and fly control, this was the job of the orderly officer for the day who was supplied from the ranks with anyone who could walk or crawl. The orderly officer would have an inspection each day accompanied by the C.O., medical officer and a few lesser hangers on, sergeants, corporals, etc. Quite a parade.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">The day things went bad was the day T. A. Williams used petrol instead of disinfectant. This was normally just poured in each hole so four gallons is a fair bit mixed with paper which only officers got and anything else that proved satisfactory instead. I never saw any toilet paper with our stores.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">The track to Black Cat went along the bottom of the latrines and was always quite well worn in and out. There was a notice up saying that you didn’t have to salute officers if you were on the toilet which was very nice of them.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_4">Everything was going well, the inspection nearly carried out when Lofty Watts came racing up the track with belt undone and a worried look on his face, dropped his duds and as there was no one else on the seat grabbed the middle one and with a relieved look on his face reached for his tobacco tin and proceeded to roll a smoke, lighting it he lifted the next lid and dropped the match down the hole. Nothing happened for a few seconds then BANG, she blew up. Lofty flew up yelling ‘Shit I’m on fire!’ … and the place looked like it had been hit by a bomb. The Orderly party was a mess covered in toilet paper  and shit. I’d never seen such a mess but couldn’t do anything for laughing. Lofty had a badly burnt arse that needed treatment for a day or two and was reported wounded in action … difficult to explain how it happened so it was put down as enemy action caused by a mortar going down one of the holes and exploding. So that covered our end of it but when word got about nobody would go near the toilet if Lofty was enthroned and word was around Wau that we were that tough that a good fart could cause you damage 10 feet away. So much for second-hand rumours. <br /></p>
