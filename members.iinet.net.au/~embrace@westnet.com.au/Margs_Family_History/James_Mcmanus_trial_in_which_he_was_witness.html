                  <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_1">George Bulloc and Peter Cooney were indicted, the former for stealing, and the latter for receiving, knowing it to be stolen, a horse, the property of Hanibal McArthur, Esq. at Melville, on the 26th of January last. A second count in the information laid the property in James McManus. The ATTORNEY GENERAL briefly stated the case, in support of which he called the following witnesses. James McManus resides near Parramatta, is pound-keeper; remembers having two horses in his possession about the 26th of January last; they were found straying and were impounded; witness advertised them as being in his custody ; they were delivered to the prisoner Bulloc, who came and claimed them as belonging to a man named Lewis, whom he stated resided at Bunbury Curran ; witness believed that Bulloc was sent by the proper owner ; he described the horses and paid the necessary expenses. Dr. Harris, is a Magistrate at Parramatta; ordered two horses, a bay and a grey, to be impounded; they were found straying on his farm ; they were on the farm a considerable time before they were impounded; did not know the owner at that time. Thomas Parker, groom to Mr. H. McArthur, knows the horse from a foal, it was bred on his master's estate, and was lost from thence. Mr. John Thorn, chief constable at Parramatta, saw the horse before the Court, at Parramatta; McManus identified it before the Magistrate as the same which he had delivered from the pound to the prisoner Bulloc. John Whaley, a constable, resides at Bargo Brush ; knows the prisoner Cooney; he lives at Mettagang, about 9 miles distant from witness; remembers seeing him riding an iron grey horse, which he told witness he had purchased; some time after he had seen the prisoner, Robinson, a constable, called to the house of witness, and told him that he was in search of a horse belonging to Mr. McArthur, the description of which agreed  with that which witness had seen in the possession of Cooney ; they accordingly repaired to the house of the prisoner, who being asked for the horse he stated he had purchased, he said it was stolen two days after he brought it home, and that he had not seen it since; it was subsequently found on a further search, in a paddock about 3-4ths of a mile from the prisoner's dwelling, on the farm of another man. John Robinson searched the premises of the prisoner Cooney, in company with the last witness; the home was found about a mile from the house of Cooney ; Whaley said he thought the horse they found appeared taller than the one he had seen previously with Cooney ; the prisoner said it was not the same horse. Cross-examined by Counsel for Bulloc.-The horse was brought to Bargo, and afterwards delivered up to Mr. McArthur; Whaley said he thought it was taller than that which he had seen Cooney ride. For the prisoner Cooney.-Has seen the horse to-day; it is the same as brought by Whaley from Mettagang, and which be said stood taller than the one he had previously seen ; Cooney said he knew nothing of that horse. Thomas Fuller, overseer to Mr. H. McArthur; knows the horse before the Court ; witness had charge of it ; it has a small black spot under the right shoulder ; has no doubt of it being the property of Mr. McArthur, and was lost from his estate some months ago. Cross-examined,-The horse was not in witness's keeping from a foal ; don't know of any mark in his mouth. By a Juror.-A horse looks taller when he is not in good condition. John Booth Jones, groom to Mr. McArthur, knows the horse before the Court to be the property of his master ; there is a mark in the inside of his mouth from a wound received when a foal which, though closed up and invisible without, can be distinctly felt inside by the finger; witness examined the horse before the Court this morning, and he possesses that mark.  James McManus recalled,-The horse before the Court is the same as was delivered by witness from the pound to the prisoner Bulloc.The case for the prosecution having closed, Counsel for the prisoner Bulloc submitted to the Court, that the case as against him did not assume a criminal complexion. The horse, it appeared, had been entrusted to Bulloc by McManus on certain reasons, which it was incumbent on the prosecutor to shew were false reasons, and until they were so shewn, it should be taken by the Court as matter of course that they were not false. It might be that the real owner lost the horse, and yet that Bulloc might have obtained it very properly, as after being lost in the first instance, it might have come into the possession of another person and re-lost, and Bulloc have been employed to go and demand it. Such a presumption was but fair, and should be taken so until the contrary was shewn, and he would contend that not a tittle of evidence appeared lo shew the reasons upon which Bulloc obtained the horse to be false reasons.Mr. Rowe, for the prisoner Cooney, observed that previous to entering on the defence of his client lie should await the decision of the Court on the point of law which had been raised in defence of the prisoner Bulloc, as in the event of it producing an acquittal Cooney should be discharged as a consequence. His HONOR was of opinion that there was no evidence whatever to shew that the horse had been stolen from Mr. McArthur; it might have strayed away, and the very circumstance of it being impounded would, he thought, raise a presumption that it was not stolen. If it had been proved to have been stolen, and was found in the possession of one of the prisoners, it would then be incumbent on him to account for it; but it did not appear to him that there was any evidence to go to the Jury from which they could infer that it was stolen, and it was an indispensable principle of law, that to charge a receiver, a theft should first be proved.A Juror having observed, that some of the witnesses for the prosecution said that the horse was lost from the premises of Mr. McArthur, and that he understood them to mean stolen; the witness Parker was recalled, and deposed that his impression was, that the horse was stolen; it was in an enclosed paddock, and could not have got away unless by being driven or decoyed ; the fence was not broken in any part, and the horse could not have leaped it. Several witnesses were then called on the part of the prisoner Cooney, some of whom saw the horse publicly exposed for sale in Parramatta by Bulloc, and others who were present when Cooney bargained for the horse, for which he paid 12 or £13, which was deposed to be the full value.His HONOR recapitulated the evidence, and stated to the Jury, that if they believed the wit- nesses called on the part of Cooney, they entirely rebutted the presumption that he knew of the horse being stolen, and which knowledge was to   be collected, amongst other circumstances, from proof of buying property secretly or under value, neither of which appeared to have occurred in the case before the Court; he was therefore of opinion, that the charge against Cooney was not made out. With regard to the other prisoner, the case against him was one entirely of evidence, from which the Jury were to draw their own conclusions.-Verdict, Bulloc Guilty. Cooney Not Guilty,-Judgment of death was then recorded against Bulloc. Cooney discharged by proclamation.</p>
