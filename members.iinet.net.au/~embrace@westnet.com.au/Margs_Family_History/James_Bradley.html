                <img src="James_Bradley_files/shapeimage_2.png" alt="&#10;James Bradley was born about 1765. He was convicted at the Old Bailey in London on May 11th, 1784 of stealing a white linen handkerchief to the value of 1/- from John Hughes on May 6th. &#10;FROM DAN HUNT’S BOOK&#10;He was sentenced to seven years transportation. He was held in the hulk (or prison ship) &quot;Ceres&quot; for two years, and then transferred to another hulk, the &quot;Justitia&quot;, on January 13th, 1787. He was taken to Portsmouth to be loaded with the other convicts of the First Fleet, and embarked on the &quot;Scarborough&quot; on February 27th,1787. &#10;James arrived at Port Jackson on the &quot;Scarborough&quot; on 26 January 1788. &#10;James Bradley received 25 lashes for insolence on 23 February 1789. However, he behaved in a &quot;tolerably decent and orderly manner in the years before his sentence expired.&quot; James received a grant of 30 acres in 1794. &quot;James Bradley's seven year sentence probably expired early in 1794, because his land grant was issued on 20 February of that year. This was located at the Eastern Boundary Farms at Kissing Point which is known as Putney. It was granted by Lieutenant Governor Major Francis Grose, and a rent of one shilling per year was to become payable after ten years. It was the 161st grant made in the colony, only six years after settlement and only two years after the first grant, which had been made to James Ruse at &quot;Experiment Farm&quot;, Rose Hill (Parramatta). ￼ James and Sarah had two more children in the next two years, James Joseph, born on 15 May 1795 and Lucy, on 24 July 1796. By 1798, James Bradley was sufficiently established to become a spokesman for the residents of Kissing Point, at a government enquiry into the grievances of small farmers. He gave evidence against the Commissionary, James Williamson who was unreasonably pursuing farmers for small debts. &#10;Sarah Elizabeth Bradley, the fourth child of James and Sarah, was born on 2 March 1799. A Census of the Land and Stock held by both free settlers and emancipated convicts was carried out in 1800. James Bradley was shown on his farm at Kissing Point supporting himself and his wife. At that time he had two and a half acres under wheat and five acres of maize. Mere survival as a farmer was a considerable achievement. Robert Grant reports that of the 274 settlers living on their own land grants in 1795, only 89 were still farming in 1800.  A fifth child, George was born on 9 August 1801. By the next year, James had cleared a total of 15 acres, with one acre in wheat and seven acres in maize. He possessed three hogs and 20 bushels of maize in store. ) &#10;1803 was a busy year for James. On 10 May he received a second grant of 30 acres of land in the district of Mulgrave Place, now known as Windsor. A rent of two shillings per year was payable, commencing after five years. In the Land Grant Census of that year he was described as &quot;worthless and lazy&quot;. Possibly he was too slow in developing this second grant, which caused an irate public servant to make this adverse comment. Nothing more is heard of this new property at Mulgrave Place and possibly the grant was withdrawn. James was likely fully occupied with the development of his original farm at Kissing Point and with birth of his sixth child Thomas, on 30 December of that year. James seems to have changed direction after this episode, giving up the attempt to become a large scale landholder and turning instead to more intensive cultivation. By 1806 he had only four acres in wheat and maize production and instead had developed a half acre of orchard and garden, which appears to have been sufficient to keep his growing family. Sarah and James had four more children: John (24 February 1806), Job (23 February 1809), Rachel Rebecca (27 March 1811) and Isabella (30 December 1813). &#10;1st October 1821 had James presenting an affidavit against the Reverend Samuel Marsden who had admonished him for  drawing children away from the established church in opposition to the rules laid down by the Wesleyan Missionary Society of London. James was by then a staunch Wesleyan. In 1822, James Bradley was one of twenty-three residents of Kissing Point who submitted a Memorial to the Governor seeking permission to establish a burial ground on land obtained from John Small. They stated that many of the petitionists were in poor circumstances and experienced inconvenience and danger in removing the bodies of the dead for burial at either Sydney or Parramatta. They therefore sought the sanction of the Governor to have a part of this land appropriated as a burial ground. The oldest portion of St. Anne's Church was built on this property in 1826. The major 1828 Census showed that James Bradley was still living on his farm at Kissing Point at that time. By then he had cleared 20 acres of land, of which five aces were under cultivation.  James died on 16 February 1838 and was buried in the church yard of St. Anne's, Ryde (formerly known as St. Anne's Parish of Hunter's Hill). His gravestone can be found near the front fence, to the left of the &quot;in&quot; road, as you enter the churchyard. His son George, who was born on 9 August 1801 and who predeceased his father, is also buried in the same grave. The writing on the headstone is almost obliterated, but a fellow descendant of James Bradley and a fellow member of the Australian Society of Genealogists, arranged for it to be straightened and for a bronze plaque to be attached to it, with the following inscription - &quot;James Bradley Arrived First Fleet 26.1.1788 Died 16.2.1838.&quot;  " style="height: 1169px; left: 0px; margin-top: 32px; position: absolute; top: 0px; width: 622px; " />
