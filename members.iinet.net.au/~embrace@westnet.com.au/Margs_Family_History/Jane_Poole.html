                  <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style">Jane Poole was on the First Fleet as a 16 year old convict aboard the Charlotte. She arrived in New South Wales in January 1788 and remained in the colony until 1790.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">Jane was sent to Norfolk Island travelling on 2nd Jan 1790 aboard the Supply. She was one of 8 female and 6 male convicts aboard the Supply. The rest sailed on the Sirius which was shipwrecked at Norfolk Island upon their arrival.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"><span style="line-height: 14px; " class="style_1">‘As the Sydney food supply was scarce, Governor Phillip, to help relieve the situation, decided to send to Norfolk, at the same time as major Ross sailed, two companies of marines, five free women and children, 183 convicts and their seventeen children. Phillip anticipated that the large supplies of fish and the produce of the island’s fertile soil would keep these people from hunger.’<br /></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="line-height: 21px; " class="style_2">She remained on Norfolk Island for 2 years during which time she formed a liaison with James McManus and they had a child, Margaret. They returned to Australia in 1792 aboard the Atlantic. They may have married there. Jane had James in Sydney Cove in 1795 and John In Sydney Cove in 1797.</span><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style"> James had received a grant of 60 acres at Mulgrave Place in March 1797 then after his death on the 12 March 1800 Jane, named as his widow, received the grant of l60 acres from Governor John Hunter, subject to a proviso that the land was to be held in trust for their children and not to be disposed of without the Governor's consent. On the 6th Jan 1801 Jane is listed a a signatory on a petition from the Hawkesbury settlers.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">In 1802 Jane is listed with the particulars of the arms she held in her possession on the Hawkesbury. Richard Ridge is listed separately with his arms. <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">However sometime in 1802 Jane is recorded as living with Richard Ridge. He arrived as a convict in the Second Fleet aboard the Atlantic and by then was living on 250 acres on the Hawkesbury. Apparently this included her grants of 220 acres. By the 1806 Muster Jane together with Richard Ridge owned or leased 305 acres of which 51 were sown in grain, one in potatoes and 205 utilised as pasture. They also had a horse, two oxen, 20 hogs and 19 bushels of grain in hand. In addition to Jane's three children they supported five convicts and one freeman. In Marsden's  list of females in the Colony in 1806 a daughter, Martha, born in 1803, is recorded, but there is no mention of her in the 1806 Muster.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">Sometime between 1805 and 1809 Jane and her family went to live on the south side of George Street , Parramatta,  and Ridge remained on the Hawkesbury and married Margaret Forrester (the daughter of First Fleeter Robert Forrester) on 7 November 1809 and had at least eight children. <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">On 16 September  1820 Jane signed an agreement with the Government to exchange the Mulgrave Place property for another allotment of land, but by 1824 she was still petitioning for this new land to be allocated.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">During  the final years of her life she was housekeeper to William Parrot, shoemaker of Parramatta and when he died in 1824 he bequeathed her and her children  his property and possessions.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style">Five months before she died she left a will leaving to her son John a mare called Betty, to her daughter Margaret a mare called Gipsy and to Margaret's daughter, Harriet, a filly and a foal. Jane died on 26 November 1826, aged 58 years. She was buried near her daughter Martha (called Poole  on the tombstone) who had died on 17 June 1821, aged 18 years. She was buried on the 28th November in St. John’s Church of England Cemetery. Section 1, row 7 to the left of the gate.<br /></p>
