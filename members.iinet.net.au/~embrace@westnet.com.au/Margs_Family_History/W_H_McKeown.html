                  <p class="paragraph_style">THE PASSING OF A PIONEER.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">In the death of Mr. William Henry McKeown, sen., there has passed away one of the oldest colonists of the State, and one of the pioneers of the North Sydney district. His reminiscences of the early days in what was then called the Lane Cove district were always interesting, and the contribution he made to the material and moral welfare of the neighbourhood was such as to deserve honourable mention.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Mr. McKeown arrived in Sydney early in the year 1840, being then a lad of 19 years of age. He came from Ireland, and brought with him the sturdy qualities of the typical North of Ireland stock. His early attempts at finding a footing in Australia were associated with the care of &quot; Government men, &quot; an employment from which he shrank, and which he speedily gave up. One temporary job succeeded another, in which his self-reliance and power of adaptation were tested and developed.<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_1">About the year 1845 he accepted an engagement in connection with a newly-planted orangery in what is now called Pymble, and thither, with his young wife, he removed. Crossing from Sydney to the north side of the harbour, he </p>

                  <p class="paragraph_style_3">William Henry McKeown was born in Waringstown, County Down, Ireland in 1821. His father William was a farmer in the Waringstown/Lurgan area and his mother was  Jane Hughes. He emigrated to Australia in 1840 and worked as a superintendent of convicts when he first arrived. He went on to be a carrier, a fruit merchant and eventually an orchardist on the North Shore.  He married Harriet Moran on the 5th Feb 1845 at St. Lawrence’s Church, Sydney. In 1870 he bought Richard Hill’s beautiful orchard “Rosedale” for  £7000. He subdivided it to make Pymble Heights Estate in 1892.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_3">He was a very religious man and was responsible for the establishment of churches at Lane Cove, Church Point and other North Shore places. <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_3">He was a main instigator in the establishment of railway to the North Shore of Sydney. <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_3">He died at the age of 91 in Summerhill, Sydney where he and his wife lived with one of their daughters. <br /></p>

                  <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_1">found there was no made road into what was then the distant bush. He had to find his way through a dense forest, simply following dray tracks through the bush. A few bark; huts at intervals along the way, the abodes of sawyers and wood getters, were the only signs of occupation of the territory where now stands the thriving suburbs of North Sydney, Chatswood, Roseville, Lindfield, and Gordon. Arriving at Pymble, there was a hotel licensed to sell beer only, an old wooden church, which served also as a school and a public-house where all sorts of drink were sold. A gang or two of &quot; Government men &quot; were employed hereabout, and timber- getting was the principal occupation. Orcharding on a small scale was also being attempted. For over half a century Mr. McKeown lived in the district, and witnessed its emergence from the primitive conditions in which he found it to one of the most popular and thriving of all the environs of the city of Sydney. <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">The record of his personal struggles is interesting enough to form the subject of a popular autobiography. The path of the early settler was beset with many difficulties. Droughts were interspersed with terrific hailstorms, the latter of which occasionally stripped the orchards and rendered them comparatively unproductive for years Iabour troubles were even then in evidence although unions and strikes had not been invented. <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">The discovery of gold caused a stampede to the west of the Blue Mountains, and labourers, clerks, shop-keepers, and even lawyers forsook their wonted employ to find their El Dorado at the Turon and Tambaroora. Mr. McKeown sufficiently caught the fever to take two trips across the Mountains, but it was rather as a chartered driver in charge of organised parties, under contract for a consideration than as a gold-seeker on his own account He never believed in sudden roads to wealth and never found one for himself.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">From the first Mr. McKeown was interested in the religious welfare of the district and laboured personally and earnestly to promote it. An old stone building still stands on the Gordon-road, in Gordon, now used as a store, which was the first substantial edifice for public worship erected north of North Sydney. It was built in the early fifties, at a cost of £850, and served also as a schoolroom, with master's quarters attached. For many years this was known as &quot;Lane Cove&quot; Chapel and was served by ministers from the old York Street Methodist Church, and by local preachers of whom Mr. McKeown soon became one. The debt on it fell principally on its promoter's shoulders and quaint are the tales he used to tell of the devices resorted to to meet the interest and reduce the debt. Zeal and self-denial eventually overcame all difficulties. &quot; Revivals &quot; were frequent, and delighted the heart of the earnest man who was set upon the spiritual welfare of his neighbours. As population increased and spread, other &quot; chapels &quot; were built at Willoughby, Hornsby, Pittwater, and other places, these being the pioneer places of worship in their respective neighbourhoods. As long as strength lasted Mr. McKeown continued his  voluntary labours as a lay preacher, and at the time of his death he was probably the oldest local preacher in Methodism in Australia.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Apart from his special interest in Church matters Mr McKeown was a good citizen in respect of the interest he took in the social and material welfare of the district. He introduced new and improved methods of fruit culture. As a poultry-raiser he showed what could be done by special strains adapted for egg-production or for table use. <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">He set a high standard of commercial morality, and when on one occasion he assigned his estate--mainly through the failure of others to meet their engagements to him he subsequently paid most of his creditors in full, although under no legal obligation to do so. He was an ardent politician, and took a keen interest in public affairs right up to the last. In the days when candidates were openly nominated on nomination day, he was frequently chosen to &quot; propose &quot; a candidate from the hustings, and his local influence was such that his candidate usually topped the poll. For a period he served as an alderman in the City Council, when he was carrying on business as a wood and coal and fruit merchant in Sydney. More than once he was asked to stand for Parliament, but he could never he persuaded to become a candidate. His house was ever a centre of kindly hospitality, and the record of those who have sat at his table or slept under his roof at Roseville, Pymble where he resided for over half  a century, would be interesting as including ecclesiastics of all Churches, politicians of all hues, and commercial men from all the States and from over the seas.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Since 1880 the North Sydney district has witnessed a wonderful development, and has become one of the most popular of all the residential areas of the metropolis. The Milson's Point-Hornsby railway line has been the principal factor in bringing this about, and in securing the construction of the line Mr. McKeown took a leading part. Public meetings and deputations were organised by him, in conjunction with a few others, and successive Ministries were importuned until the work was put in hand, and at length carried to completion by the extension right to Milson's Point. With this the veteran's public work seemed to come to an end, and shortly after attaining his 80th year he removed from the scene of his half-century's labour to reside in quietude at Summerhill. On leaving, he was made the recipient of several demonstrations evincing the esteem and appreciation entertained for him and his wife (who survives him) by the residents among whom they had lived so long and usefully.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">A family of 10 children and between 50 and 60 grandchildren, with several great-grandchildren, is the best legacy the venerable pioneer has left to the State. His sons are Rev. R. McKeown of Waverley; Mr G.M. McKeown of Wagga Wagga Experiment Farm; Mr. J. McKeown of the Civil Ambulance Corps; Mr. W. H. McKeown of Ashfield; and Mr E. McKeown of Belford. His sons-in-law are Rev. G. McIntosh of Chatswood; Mr. J.G. Edwards of Killara; Mr. W. Benson of Waverley; Rev. J.E. Carruthers of Lindfield; and Mr. H. Hazlett of Summerhill.<br /></p>
