                  <p class="paragraph_style_2"> Before<a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dowling" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dowling"> Mr. Justice Dowling</a>, James Macmanus was indicted for the wilful murder of Edward Vales at Parramatta, on the 4th of October. Dr. Wardell, for the prisoner, urged that the man was unsound in his mind at the time of committing the murder. Seven officers were then sworn to determine whether the prisoner was sane or insane at the time charged.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_2"><a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Marsden" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Marsden">   Rev. Samuel Marsden</a> deposed, that he had known the prisoner, but was not aware of his derangement till within the last ten days. On the 3rd of October he observed the man, pulling at the tombstones in Parramatta church-yard by which he tore out two of his finger nails, and on the Sunday evening subsequently, about five o'clock, he again beheld prisoner who then betrayed a deranged state of intellect, and seemed to be incapable, of judging right from wrong.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_2">   Mr. Marsden's coachman, George Savage, deposed that he went to bed on Sunday evening, Oct. 4, about nine o'clock, and shortly after heard the prisoner walk out of a house opposite, and begin counting the stars as far, as nine ; the man. continued after this walking up and down-for about an hour and a half, talking all the time most incoherently; about twelve o'clock hearing, a crash of broken glass, Savage continued to depose, that he got up and alarmed the chief constable, who dispatched a sub-constable with him to the church yard, when after climbing over the gate, and glancing an eye about, he spied the maniac in a small lodge, sprinkling water about him; on getting nearer the door, the maniac was heard to cry, &quot; I'll wash my hands, and wash them clean&quot; as he turned to wash his hands, Savage ran up to the door, and pulled it to - then opened it a little, and peeped, when the maniac flung water in his face, saying, &quot; thou art saved.&quot; Savage said, &quot;Jem, come along with me, and I'll take you home to your brother's ;&quot; Macmanus replied, &quot;Ah, do you know me, I have conquered the devil ;&quot; on looking round the room Savage beheld a dead body stretched along the ground, the neck, and face of which were desperately lacerated, an axe lying near it appeared to be covered with blood ; Savage exclaimed to the constable outside, he's killed old Neddy, meaning deceased, who was 74 years of age, and both secured Macmanus in the church-yard a short time, after being obliged to knock him down, as he defended himself furiously.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_2"> Mr Justice Dowling having put it to the Commission to say, whether from the evidence that had been adduced, they could consider the prisoner as a madman or one in possession of his intellects. Without retiring, a verdict was returned by the panel, that the prisoner was of unsound mind at the time of committing the act described. The Judge then directed, that the prisoner should be kept in close confinement till his Majesty's pleasure be made known upon the subject; which in all likelihood will be a period of 10 months. The prisoner did not exhibit any symptoms of insanity at the bar.<br /></p>

In this line of work he caught a highway man, showing much sensitivity and bravery. Events in 1828 are shrouded in conjecture, the next 10 years of his life are believed to have been spent in the Parramatta Lunatic Asylum where he died on 6th Nov 1839. A report in the Australian on 7th Oct 1829 states as follows :- <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_2">&quot;HORRIBLE CATASTROPHE&quot;<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_2">On Sunday evening last a man named James Poole who is known to have for some years, in one of his usual fits commenced flinging stones at the windows of St. John's church in Parramatta. The bell ringer who was employed at the time on a peal, stepped outside to discover who was committing the sacriligious devastation , when he was seized upon bones and body, by the maniac, flung on the ground, and speedily disburthened of his head by an axe, with which the infuriated wretch chanced to be provided. With demonical vengeance the madman next plucked out the eyes of his victim from the severed head. He was shortly after taken into custody, and when discovered was in a state of nudity. This horrible affair has created no ordinary sensation.&quot; ( note that he sometimes used the name of Poole , which was his mothers maiden name).<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_2">In the Australian dated 16/10/1829, the court trial of McManus appeared. In conclusion &quot; the panel declared that McManus was of unsound mind at the time of committing the act.

                  <p class="Free_Form">HORRID MURDER. – An inquest was held at Parramatta on Monday evening last, on the body of Edward Vallace, found murdered in the lodge in the church yard at Parramatta. The deceased resided in the place as bellman of the church and keeper of the keys. The circumstances attending this shocking event are as follows : - A man named James Macmanus, who had for some time laboured under a mental derangement, from an intemperate use of spirituous liquors, escaped from the servant in whose charge he was placed, on the Sunday evening, and was not seen by him again, until about 12 o’clock at night ; the noise of the smashing of the windows of the church, which the house nearly adjoined, gave him information that his charge was committing mischief. He ran out, and going into the churchyard, the first thing which arrested his attention, was a light in the lodge. Approaching the door, he saw Macmanus sprinkling water, with both hands, on the floor;  the servant reached forward and pulled the door a-jar, when Macmanus, who had just exclaimed, “I have washed my hands”, turned round, and threw the water off his hands into the servants face, saying, “I will wash you too.” He then sat down, and immediately afterwards exclaimed, “I have killed the devil,” upon which the servant looked down, and for the first time, saw the deceased lying on the floor. He immediately ran for a constable, and Macmanus was taken into custody in the churchyard, in about 20 minutes after, quite naked, and raving. The sight which presented itself to the jury upon the view, could not be beheld without shuddering. The head was nearly separate from the body, by three deep cuts across the neck; the under jaw was gone, and the tongue lying in the middle of the floor, as was also the right eye; the head and body exhibited, in many parts, other bruises and wounds, any of which would have been sufficient to have deprived the sufferer of life, and the floor was deluged with blood.<br /></p>
                  <p class="Free_Form">Upon a patient investigation of the circumstances of the case, by a highly intelligent Jury, until a late hour of the night, a verdict was returned against Macmanus, of <span class="style_2">Wilful Murder</span>, committed under derangement, arising from the intemperate use of spirituous liquors.<br /></p>
