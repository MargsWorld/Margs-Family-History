He wrote in his famous diary about releasing her from his employment when it was discovered that she was pregnant and he also wrote about her subsequent marriage to Samuel Cudble. &quot;James Woodforde: the Diary of a Country Parson: 1758-1802”.&#13;Elizabeth was the child born of the diary reference followed by Anne. It is believed through extensive research that Hannah was not their biological daughter. After the death of Samuel and Mary's daughter Ann in 1807, they took in Hannah who was actually born in 1801 and was herself baseborn. The discrepancy in Hannah's birth dates are common from parish to parish. In 1826 Hannah gave birth to a son, John Cuthbert Cudbird in Norwich. He was baseborn as well. &#13;Hannah subsequently married Wright Thompson on 20th February 1831 in Barford, Norfolk. John Cuthbert went to live with his grandparents Samuel and Mary Cudbell. Wright and Hannah returned to Culpitt’s Farm, Norfolk to live with his parents and grandmother. In October 1831 Emily arrives followed by Thomas (1833), Ann (1835) and George(1837). By April 1837 Wright, Hannah and the 4 children are boarding a wagon for the rough ride to London and the journey aboard the ‘City of Edinburgh’ to Australia. The voyage to Australia was long and monotonous, particularly in the early days of travel when a sailing ship could take up to four months to reach Australia.  Living conditions were notoriously bad with poor sanitation, cramped quarters and rations that were not much better than what the convicts received.  " style="height: 597px; left: 0px; margin-top: 11px; position: absolute; top: 0px; width: 345px; " />

They settled on land in the area and there are still signs of their presence with Thompson’s Creek Dam now a tourist spot between Wallerawang and Portland.&#10;Hannah gave birth to another 5 children at Piper’s Flat. Jane was the 2nd last child born on the 28th June 1845.&#10;Life appears to have become more difficult for the Thompson’s and by 12 September 1858 they were separated. The following notice was placed in the Sydney Morning Herald.&#10;&#10;￼&#10;&#10;By 1858 Jane would have been 13 years of age and presumably living with her mother. Wright has become an innkeeper at the Forest Inn at Blackman’s Flat and died in 1868. An inquest was held but an open finding was recorded.
