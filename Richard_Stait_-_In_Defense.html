The war against Napoleon had finished in 1815 and over 100,000 of the soldiers that had been employed in that war returned home. They provided a ready source of cheap labour and unemployment and poverty became rife, particularly in rural areas.   To add to these difficulties the Enclosure Act was passed. This act allowed for the fencing of the common lands which once had assisted the commoners to keep some livestock for their own sustenance. “In the 17th century the ham was  said to be a free common from Lammas to Candlemas and each freeman could pasture 3 horses, 6 cows, or 10 sheep provided they were his own.”In Tewkesbury the Enclosure Act was enforced in 1811, one year before Richard’s birth and the land was taken from the people. &#10;This occurred just before the introduction of the threshing machine which in rural communities was devastating to the agricultural workers. Previously they had been employed year round and usually provided with accommodation on the landholders property. With the advent of the threshing machine the rural workforce was casualised or left under-employed. In 1830 and 1831 this situation fomented the ‘Swing Riots’ in southern England including Gloucestershire.&#10;It was into this social breakdown that Richard was born.&#10;Richard’s father James was not an agricultural worker but a ‘waterman’ on the Avon or Severn River. I think because they were a mobile population counties were not that eager to recognise watermen and their families as citizens of their county as in the event of hardship they would be responsible for paying the Poor Relief. &#10;In the 1820s high poor rates led to increasing attempts to cut relief. Between 1815 and 1820 Poor Law expenditure was 12/10d per capita; by 1830 it was 9/9d. Reductions were made by making the Poor Law a deterrent and by stopping people asking for relief. This created a hatred of the Poor Law but it is also noticeable that between 1824 and 1830, rural crime rates increased by 30% - mainly poaching and food thefts.&#10;It was about this time that James Staight died, on the 2nd May 1823. This left Richard 11; John 14 and Hannah 9 to make do as best they could without a bread winner.  &#10;Wendy Snarey, a Gloucestershire historian said: – often the wife and children would travel on the boat as a family. I think in this case with John, Richard’s older brother,  and Richard being baptised on the same day that they were not necessarily babes but more that it was convenient for the parents to do this if it was likely they were going to settle in Tewkesbury. It would allow them to access poor relief if needed. &#10;She also said: I think the 1830s here was as close to revolution as we have ever had. Poverty was rife and the lowly man had no say in how the country was run. The vast majority of criminal cases during the 1700s were brought before local magistrates, who dealt with crimes without the benefit of a jury. Magistrates were themselves unpaid officials who were drawn from the ranks of the wealthy, and were expected to defend the English law as amateurs. As a result, many magistrates were easily corrupted.Every parish was obliged to have one or two constables, who were selected every year from local communities, and were unpaid volunteers. These constables were required to perform policing duties only in their spare time, and many simply paid for substitutes to stand in for them. If you or your family got on the wrong side of them they could make your life very difficult.

The only way to expand was to build behind the main towns existing properties, or add more storeys to existing ones, and alleyways were how these new properties/storeys were reached. As the alleys were only built just wide enough for a man to pass on foot, many alleys were so narrow that some of the buildings along them almost touched at the eaves above.<br /></span></p>
